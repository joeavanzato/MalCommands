  risk: High
  risk_reason: BITS jobs are typically predictable and used for regular update tasks or other functions - their use with cmd.exe directly is uncommon and suspicious.
  fidelity: High
  fidelity_reason: While alerting on BITS activity alone would not be useful, alerting on more specific properties of the command and on anomalous or one-off BITS commandlines should yield effective results.
