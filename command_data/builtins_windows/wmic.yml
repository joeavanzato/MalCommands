  risk: High
  risk_reason: The use of wmic to retrieve a remote file, while possible for legitimate reasons, should be viewed as highly suspicious.
  fidelity: Medium
  fidelity_reason: This is a particularly uncommon way for IT Operators to download remote files and should be audited in context with other alerts or events.

  risk: High
  risk_reason: Attaching files to debuggers is a high-risk activity that should only be performed by developers actively debugging their own software.
  fidelity: High
  fidelity_reason: This is typically an uncommon activity - developers who actively debug software should potentially have different allow-listing in place to remove false positives.
