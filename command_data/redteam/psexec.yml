  risk: High
  risk_reason: PSExec usage is generally high-risk and should be audited to ensure it is legitimate due to the prevalent usage by threat actors.
  fidelity: Medium
  fidelity_reason: PSExec usage should always be audited to ensure it is legitimate, although it is often used by IT operators so there can be a large dynamic volume depending on the organization.
