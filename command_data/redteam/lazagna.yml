  risk: Critical
  risk_reason: The observation of 'lazagne' in a commandline should raise immediate red-flags - the PE file is typically renamed - however the commandline arguments often remain the same.
  fidelity: High
  fidelity_reason: Observing 'lazagne' with corresponding arguments in a commandline will typically only occur when a threat-actor is hands-on-keyboard.
