# Command should contain the full commandline being documented.
# Description should describe what the commandline is doing and how it is doing it - NOT documenting the tool being abused (that is done in tool documentation)
# killchain should include any relevant Cyber Killchain Phases
# MITRE Tactics/Techniques should be documented with new tactics as individual array-keys
# OS should contain any relevant Operating Systems
# References should contain a list of references for this specific command-line
# Risk should contain (Low|Medium|High|Critical) based on the potential consequences of this particular command)
# Risk Reason should contain the reasoning for the assigned risk
# Fidelity should contain (Low|Medium|High) based upon the potential false-positives or noise from alerting on this particular commandline
# Fidelity Reason should describe why the fidelity is rated as such - is the command rare for most orgs, is this particular sequence of arguments rare or common, is it a common tool that happens to be abused, etc.
# tool should contain the name of the primary tool in use, without extensions
# ThreatActors should contain Group ID from MITRE with relevant references for each group - then we will do a join in the future on an actors_collection data-sequence which contains additional Actor details such as Alias, etc.
